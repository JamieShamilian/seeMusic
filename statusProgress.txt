boot linux on rasberrypi
connected to USB mouse keyboard hdmi screen

update linux with emacs and other tools

ran sample python code on rasberry pi

developed idea to help hard of hearing enjoy music
by syncornozing LED lights

found the jinglebells python project.

created a breadboard LED connected to GPIO pins

ran jinglebells python program to make leds light at
rate similar to jinglebells on rasberrypi/breadboard LED

attach USB microphone input 
read microphone input to python script

use numPy to preform FFT on raw data.

use frequency response and amplitude data returned by FFT function
to light the LEDs.

tested ran the sample music files using vlc.
( problems with feedback )

ran music files using phone.
works better, but cant take video at the same time ?

need to tweak the amplitude at different frequencies to make LEDs work correctly.
( may need to use log scale based on frequency band )
